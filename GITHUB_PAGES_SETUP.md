# ðŸš€ GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

## The build failed because GitHub Pages needs to be manually enabled first.

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages
1. **Go to your repository**: https://github.com/BadhonAhmad/BadhonAhmad.github.io
2. **Click on "Settings"** tab (at the top of the repository)
3. **Scroll down to "Pages"** section in the left sidebar
4. **Under "Source"**, select **"Deploy from a branch"**
5. **Select branch**: `gh-pages` 
6. **Select folder**: `/ (root)`
7. **Click "Save"**

### Step 2: Wait for Deployment
- After enabling Pages, the GitHub Actions workflow will run automatically
- Your site will be available at: **https://badhonAhmad.github.io**
- Initial deployment may take 5-10 minutes

### Step 3: Alternative Manual Setup (if workflow fails)
If the automatic deployment doesn't work, you can manually deploy:

```bash
# In your Portfolio folder
cd Portfolio
npm run build
```

Then upload the `out` folder contents to the `gh-pages` branch.

### âœ… Your Portfolio Features
- Modern Next.js 15 portfolio
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Typing animations
- Social media integration
- Project showcases with GitHub links
- Competitive programming achievements
- Professional CV download

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting
- **If Pages isn't working**: Make sure you select "Deploy from a branch" and choose `gh-pages` branch
- **If workflow fails**: Check the Actions tab for error details
- **If site is blank**: Ensure the `out` folder is being generated correctly

Your portfolio will be live once GitHub Pages is enabled! ðŸŒŸ
